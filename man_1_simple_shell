.SH NAME
.B hsh
-Simple shell implementation of UNIX command line - Holberton school Project
.PP

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh
.PP

.SH Description
This is a simple command line interpreter capable of executing commands read
from standard input. This shell works in the same way as .B sh.

.SH Overview
The shell is a program that reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and  executes other commands. Commands can be typed directly to the.

.SH Invocation
Shell could be run in interactive mode where input is accepted from the keyboard ./hsh.  It also works in a non-interactive mode, the shell is run from a script or standard input from a echo standard output. echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh.

To run the shell you should compile all the .c files in the repo with GNU Comiler Collectio and execute the output file, as follow:
.P
.RS
.B $ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
.P
.RE
Where hsh would be the file to execute:
.RS
.B $ ./hsh
.P
.RE
Simple Shell would be run in interactive mode by executing the hsh. Once you execute it, a prompt ($ ) will appear waiting for you to type a command followed by an enter. Once you press enter the shell will execute the command and a new prompt ('$') will appear again expecting a new command. To close the shell you have to type exit or ctrl D.

The non-interactive mode uses shell scripts. This includes the use of piping ('|'). Example:
.P
.RS
.B echo '/bin/ls' | ./hsh
